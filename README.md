# AryaKris-Portfolio
To demonstrate relevant skills and abilities
The assignment includes building a portfolio from scratch and deploying it to GitHub. 

# HTML 
This part includes the declarative header section, the body (where I tried to add the About me and Work sections) and the Footer (Contact). The first step was to give an outline for the portfolio by creating an index.html and then using an external CSS sheet to improvise the page with necessary stylings.
